# Data

## Description

## Missing value analysis

```{r}
nsch_df <- read.csv("data/nsch.csv")
missing_df <- nsch_df[apply(is.na(nsch_df), 1, any), ]
dim(nsch_df)
dim(missing_df)
```

The dataset is large enough even after revoming the missing value. However, the proportion of NAs is too large so we have to figure out what is going on here.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(nsch_df)) |>
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) |>
  barplot(cex.names=0.7, las=2)
```
