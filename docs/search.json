    "text": "1.2 Motivation\nChildren’s mental health is a subject of increasing concern in contemporary society, with growing awareness of the impact of early experiences on long-term mental and emotional outcomes. Mental health issues in childhood not only affect the individual child but can also have lasting effects into adulthood. Understanding the determinants of mental health in children is crucial for developing effective interventions and support systems. It carries public health significance, contributing to the overall understanding of mental health burdens, influencing families and communities, and informing evidence-based policies and programs."

    "text": "1.3 Research Questions\n\nThe relationship between Children’s mental health and Guardians’ background: How do guardians’ employment status affect children’s mental health? Are children whose guardians have higher education more likely to have anxiety? Do children tend to have better mental health if their guardians have better mental health? How does Guardian’s military experience influence children’s mental status? Whether the age of Guardians and children serve as a potential factor of mental health issues?\nChildren’s experience and mental health: Are children more likely to be depressed if they have been treated unfairly because of gender identity or sexual orientation? How does being a victim of violence, living with people with alcohol problems, and experiencing parent divorce affect children’s mental health respectively?\nMutual effect of mental health problems on children: Do children who have one mental issue tend to suffer from other problems as well? How do other factors affect the number of mental illnesses children have?\nRelationship between physical health and mental health."

    "text": "2.1 Description\n\n2.1.1 Data Source\nWe obtained the data from the United States Census Bureau Website, which is an official website of the US government. The data is collected from 2022 NSCH (National Survey of Children’s Health), a national and state-level survey on information related to the physical and mental health of children from 0 to 17 years old. The survey is conducted by the United States Census Bureau, Associate Director for Demographic Programs on behalf of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) .\n\n\n2.1.2 Format of the data, Frequency of updates, Dimensions\nThe 2022 Topical Data is originally in SAS format. The NSCH is conducted every year, so the data is collected and released every year. Specifically, the NSCH 2022 was collected from July 2022 to January 2023. The data has two dimensions. Each row represents a sample, and each column represents the answers to each question in the questionnaires. The 2022 Topical Data file includes records for 54,103 children (54103 rows), and there are answers to 490 questions for each child (490 columns). Issues / problems with the data The data is collected from questionnaires, so some information may not be complete. The 2022 topical data file involves both the complete and sufficient partial topical questionnaires. Therefore, we need to deal with missing values before we conduct analyses. Besides, the data involves different aspects of children’s health and well-being, but our purpose is to focus on children’s mental health. So we need to carefully identify and choose the relevant information from the 490 columns.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Import the data\nThe original data is in SAS format, and it is not that easy to analyze. Thus, we plan to convert the data to csv format manually and store it as “nsch.csv”. Then, we just need to import the “nsch.csv” file into R-studio in DataFrame format to prepare the data for analyses."

Living environments like family structure and household sizes can be also considered when evaluating the correlation with mental health issues.\nChildren’s Experience\nACE1, ACE10, ACE11, ACE12, ACE3, ACE4, ACE5, ACE6, ACE7, ACE8, ACE9, BULLIED_R, BULLY, EVERHOMELESS, GRADES\nIn this category, guardians are asked to unveil their child’s traumatic experience like being treated unfairly and living in an unsettled environment. In addition, experience of peer relationship (bully, grade) are also subjects to be tested.\nPhysical Health\nFASD, GENETIC, HOURSLEEP, PHYSACTIV, PHYSICALPAIN\nBy accessing the relation between mental health issues and physical health factors like activity frequency and hours of sleep, we can answer the last category of questions.\nMental Health Indicator\nK2Q30A, K2Q31A, K2Q32A, K2Q33A, K2Q34A, K2Q35A, K2Q37A, K2Q38A\nThese are the target variables, which includes YES/NO questions on whether this child is diagnosed to have mental health issues.\nTreatment Indicator\nK4Q22_R, K4Q23\nInformation of whether this child has taken treatments/medication or not.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Visualizations\nSince almost all questions in this census have categorical answers, we can use contingency tables to draw stacked bar charts, Cleveland dot plots and mosaic plots to see the correlation. As shown above, we kept a large set of variables to explore, and we might want to try PCA as well to reduce dimension.\nPlease refer to the official variable list provided on the website for detailed question prompts."

If we check the meaning of variables, we can see that these columns are questions related to “Child Experienced”. The question prompt starts with “To the best of your knowledge”, and only 2 options (1=Yes or 2=No) are provided. People who take the questionaire might take this question as an optional one and leave it blank when they are unsure about the answer. If our inference here is correct, we can drop those rows without concerning serious effects.\n\n\n2.3.2 Frequency of rowSums()\nFor other columns, we would want to look at the rowSums() frequency.\nWe are going to first remove columns starts with “ACE” (see previous section for analysis) and columns with 0 missing values. Then we filter to only include rows containing NA. We can see the dimension of missing value dataframe:\n\n\nCode\nnsch_df_except_ace &lt;- nsch_df[,-seq(16,25)]\ncol_wo_na &lt;- c(\"HHID\", \"A1_GRADE\", \"HHCOUNT\", \"HIGRADE_TVIS\")\ncol_names &lt;- names(nsch_df_except_ace)\nnsch_df_except_ace &lt;- nsch_df_except_ace[,-which(col_names %in% col_wo_na)]\nmissing_except_ace &lt;- is.na(nsch_df_except_ace)\nnsch_df_except_ace &lt;- nsch_df_except_ace[apply(missing_except_ace, 1, any), ]\ndim(nsch_df_except_ace)\n\n\n[1] 3547   30\n\n\nThen, we can draw the frequency bar chart of the missing vale of each row.\n\n\nCode\nfreq_table_na_each_row &lt;- rowSums(is.na(nsch_df_except_ace)) |&gt; table()\nbarplot(freq_table_na_each_row, cex.names=0.6,\n        main=\"Frequency of Missing Value Counts of Each Row\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values represented by each bin are:\n\n\nCode\nfreq_table_na_each_row\n\n\n\n   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16 \n2636  402  159   89  102   42   31   26   23    9   10    8    4    1    3    1 \n  18 \n   1 \n\n\nAfter ignoring missing value in “ACE” columns, we can see among 3547 rows containing missing values, 2636 of them only have 1 value missing. This indicates that it is unlikely to have causal relationship between missing values in columns. We are going to validate this statement by drawing a correlation matrix on missing values.\n\n\n2.3.3 Correlation Matrix\nUsing an indicator dataframe, we put 1 on the position where the truncated dataframe has NA in that position, and put 0 otherwise. We are going to draw a correlation matrix of this indicator to see whether missing a value in column A lead to missing a value in column B.\n\n\nCode\ncor_matrix &lt;- cor(as.data.frame(missing_except_ace) +1-1)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# Reshape the correlation matrix for ggplot\ncor_df &lt;- as.data.frame(as.table(cor_matrix))\nnames(cor_df) &lt;- c(\"Var1\", \"Var2\", \"Corr\")\n\n# Plot the correlation matrix using ggplot2\nheatmap &lt;- ggplot(cor_df, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = Corr)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", size = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\", mid=\"white\",\n                       name = \"Correlation\", midpoint = 0) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Correlation Matrix\")\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nCode\n# Display the plot\nprint(heatmap)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see no extreme correlation is found. Given that the dataset is large enough and most columns are categorical, we choose to remove missing values."

    "text": "3.2 Guardian’s Influence on Children’s Mental Health\nGuardian can play a variety of roles in children’s life: caregiver, educator, friends, and spirit leader. In this section, we are going to explore the relationship between guardian’s information and child’s mental health issues. Notice that this survey of children’s health is filled by A1, one of the child’s guardians, while some questions asked about background information of the whole household.\n\n3.2.1 Full-time Employment + Education\n\n\nCode\npar_grade_employ &lt;- nsch_df |&gt;\n  mutate(Fully_Employed = ifelse(nsch_df$A1_EMPLOYED == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Child_mental_struggle = ifelse(rowSums(nsch_df[, mental_ls] == 1) &gt; 0,\n                                      \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(Fully_Employed, A1_GRADE, Child_mental_struggle)|&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n())\n  \nmosaic(Child_mental_struggle ~ Fully_Employed + A1_GRADE,\n       data=par_grade_employ, direction=c(\"h\", \"v\", \"h\")) \n\n\n\n\n\nA1_EMPLOYED ‐ Adult 1 ‐ Current Employment Status (T1 T2 T3)\nWhich of the following best describes your current employment status?\n1 = 8th grade or less\n2 = 9th‐12th grade; No diploma\n3 = High School Graduate or GED Completed\n4 = Completed a vocational, trade, or business school program\n5 = Some College Credit, but No Degree\n6 = Associate Degree (AA, AS)\n7 = Bachelor’s Degree (BA, BS, AB)\n8 = Master’s Degree (MA, MS, MSW, MBA)\n9 = Doctorate (PhD, EdD) or Professional Degree (MD, DDS, DVM, JD)\nThis graph explain the co-effect of A1’s education level and employment status on child’s mental health. We didn’t include other employment type like partly employed, and we didn’t separate mental struggles into specific health issues like depression or anxiety. We tried to find a general pattern of A1’s influence in terms of their work and knowledge. Here’s what we find:\n\nAmong all the children been investigated, children with mental health problem is less than a half.\nFully employed people mostly comes from educational background 7 and 8, which means that the highest school completed are Bachelor’s Degree (BA, BS, AB) or Master’s Degree (MA, MS, MSW, MBA).\nNo matter A1 is fully employed or not, when A1 has Some College Credit, but No Degree or Associate Degree (AA, AS), their child is slightly easier to be told to have mental issues based on the higher proportion indicated in the mosaic plot.\nWhen A1 identify themselves to complete 12th grade or less school, a smaller proportion of their child reports mental health struggles.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 WIthin children with mental struggles, what’s proportion of each problem with respect to A1_MENTHEALTH, facet by FAMILY_R\n\n\nCode\ntheme_heat &lt;- theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank())\nnsch_df |&gt;\n  mutate(Child_mental_struggle = ifelse(rowSums(nsch_df[, mental_ls] == 1) &gt; 0,\n                                      \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  filter(Child_mental_struggle == \"Yes\") |&gt;\n  rename(\"LearningDisability\" = \"K2Q30A\",\n         \"ADD/ADHD\" = \"K2Q31A\",\n         \"Depression\" = \"K2Q32A\",\n         \"Anxiety\" = \"K2Q33A\",\n         \"BehaviorProblems\" = \"K2Q34A\",\n         \"AutismASD\" = \"K2Q35A\",\n         \"SpeechDisorder\" = \"K2Q37A\",\n         \"TouretteSyndrome\" = \"K2Q38A\") |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = LearningDisability:TouretteSyndrome,\n               names_to = \"Issues\") |&gt;\n  select(all_of(c(\"FAMILY_R\", \"A1_MENTHEALTH\", \"Issues\", \"value\"))) |&gt;\n  filter(value == 1) |&gt;\n  group_by(FAMILY_R, A1_MENTHEALTH, Issues) |&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n()) |&gt;\n  group_by(FAMILY_R, A1_MENTHEALTH) |&gt; \n  mutate(Total = sum(Freq)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = A1_MENTHEALTH, y = Issues)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = (Freq/Total)), color = \"white\") +\n  coord_fixed() + \n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(~FAMILY_R, ncol = 4) + theme_heat\n\n\n\n\n\nFAMILY_R ‐ Family Structure (T1 T2 T3)\n1 = Two biogical/adoptive parents, currently married\n2 = Two biogical/adoptive parents, not currently married\n3 = Two parents (at least one not biological/adoptive), currently married\n4 = Two parents (at least one not biological/adoptive), not currently married\n5 = Single mother\n6 = Single father\n7 = Grandparent household\n8 = Other relation\nA1_MENTHEALTH ‐ Adult 1 ‐ Mental or Emotional Health (T1 T2 T3)\nIn general, how is your mental or emotional health?\n1 = Excellent\n2 = Very Good\n3 = Good\n4 = Fair\n5 = Poor\nIn this heatmap, we explored the distribution of mental health issues among each different family structure and A1’s mental health status. A1’s mental status is indicated by number in the x-axis (larger number means less healthy), and each facet represent a different family structure. In each column of each facet, the heatmap value (Freq/Total) can be summed to 1. Notice that since a child might have multiple mental health issues, here the total Freq will not be the total number of children having struggles (Freq &gt; NumPeople). Here’s what we’ve discovered:\n\nAmong all mental issues, Tourette Syndrome have fewest proportion for mostly of times. Disregarding the Simpson’s paradox, we can probability conclude from the graph that this is the least common issues among the 8 problems we investigated.\nOutliers are find mostly in A1 with poor mental status from family structure 7 and 8. This might implies that poor mental health status of guardians and non-mainstream family structure (Grandparent household or Other) together have a negative impact on children. Or this might be just an coincidence because of small sample size of these group.\nExcept for A1 with poor mental status from family structure 7 and 8, distribution of child’s mental problems seem to have the following pattern:\n\nAnxiety and ADD/ADHD are the most common issues, and Tourette Syndrome and Autism ASD are the least common issues.\nAmong children who have mental disease and have a guardian reporting a poor mental status, a larger proportion is having Anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Treatment\n\n\nCode\nnsch_df |&gt;\n  mutate(Treatment = ifelse(nsch_df$K4Q22_R == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(mental_ls, names_to = \"Issues\") |&gt;\n  filter(value == 1) |&gt;\n  select(all_of(c(\"Issues\", \"Treatment\"))) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(Issues)), fill = Treatment)) +\n  geom_bar() + labs(x = \"Issues\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels=c(\n    K2Q30A = \"LearningDisability\",\n    K2Q31A = \"ADD/ADHD\",\n    K2Q32A = \"Depression\",\n    K2Q33A = \"Anxiety\",\n    K2Q34A = \"BehaviorProblems\",\n    K2Q35A = \"AutismASD\",\n    K2Q37A = \"SpeechDisorder\",\n    K2Q38A = \"TouretteSyndrome\")) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are also curious about how many child has received treatment after they are been diagnosed. The counting strategy is the same with the previous heatmap: we are counting the cases instead of total people because there exist people with multiple mental problems. From this bar chart, we found that Anxiety and ADD/ADHD are the most common problems. In addition, Anxiety and depression have very high treatment rate. Even though Learning Disability and Speech Disorder have similar total case as Depression (even higher), most of children didn’t get treatment. This might be caused by the capability and advisement of counseling institutes. Also, guardians’ tend to believe that Behavior Problem and Learning Disability will disappear when the child grow up. Let’s explore how does the age of A1 influence there choice of having their child treated or not.\n\n\nCode\nnsch_df |&gt;\n  mutate(Treatment = ifelse(nsch_df$K4Q22_R == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Child_mental_struggle = ifelse(rowSums(nsch_df[, mental_ls] == 1) &gt; 0,\n                                      \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  filter(Child_mental_struggle == \"Yes\") |&gt;\n  select(all_of(c(\"A1_AGE\", \"Treatment\"))) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = A1_AGE, y=Treatment)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(bandwidth = 1, scale = 0.5) + geom_boxplot(width=0.5) +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot & Ridgeline plots of Guardien's Age Distribution with/without Treatment\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph, we are not looking at cases anymore. One child will only match one data point of the plotting dataframe. We are looking for the A1’s Age distribution of children who suffer from mental issues. From the Ridgeline, we can see that ages are roughly normally distributed. Among the 2 distribution, children without treatment have a slight right skewed guardian’s age distribution. It is hard to tell more difference from ridgeline alone.\nThus, we add boxplots to the graph, and we can find that the median age of A1 who has their children treated is higher. This might be caused by stronger economic support they can provide."

    "text": "3.3 Children’s experience and mental health\nChildren’s mental well-being is intricately linked to their life experiences, with unfair or distressing encounters potentially contributing to various mental health challenges. Consequently, our objective is to delve into the correlation between children’s experiences and the emergence of mental health issues.\n\n3.3.1 Are children more likely to be depressed if they have been treated unfairly because of gender identity or sexual orientation?\n\n\nCode\nicecreamcolors &lt;- c(\"#ff99ff\", \"#cc9966\") \nunfair_depress &lt;- nsch_df |&gt;\n  mutate(Depression = ifelse(nsch_df$K2Q32A == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Unfair_identity = ifelse(nsch_df$ACE10 == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(Unfair_identity,Depression)|&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n())\nmosaic(Depression ~ Unfair_identity, data=unfair_depress, direction = c(\"v\",\"h\"), main = \"Depression and Unfair Treatment from Identity\",highlighting_fill = icecreamcolors)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo investigate this question, we drew a mosaic plot with two variables:\nunfair_identity: referred as ACE10 in the original data, showing whether the child has ever experienced unfair treatments because of gender identity or sexual orientation\ndepression: referred as K2Q32A in the original data, showing whether the child has depression\nThe mosaic plot analysis reveals a compelling connection between the independent variable “unfair_identity” and the dependent variable “depression.” Specifically, when examining the data by splitting “depression” horizontally and “unfair_identity” vertically, a notable pattern emerges: children who have experienced unfair treatment due to their gender identity or sexual orientation appear to be more susceptible to depression.\nThese findings underscore the importance of heightened awareness among parents, educators, and schools regarding the potential mental health impact on children who face discrimination based on their identities. The data strongly suggests that such children may require additional care and support to navigate the challenges associated with unfair treatment.\n\n\n3.3.2 How does being a victim of violence, living with people with alcohol problems, and experiencing parent divorce affect children’s mental health respectively?\n\n\nCode\nvictim_mental &lt;- nsch_df |&gt;\n  mutate(Child_mental_struggle = ifelse(rowSums(nsch_df[, mental_ls] == 1) &gt; 0,\"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Victim_violence = ifelse(nsch_df$ACE7 == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Alcohol_drug = ifelse(nsch_df$ACE9 == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Parent_divorce = ifelse(nsch_df$ACE3 == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n  #group_by(Victim_violence, Alcohol_drug,Parent_divorce,Child_mental_struggle)|&gt;\n  #summarize(Freq = n())\nvictim_mental &lt;- select(victim_mental,Child_mental_struggle,Victim_violence,Alcohol_drug,Parent_divorce)\n#pairs(table(victim_mental), highlighting = 2,text_panel=list(cex.labels=0.5))\nvictim_mental &lt;- pivot_longer(victim_mental,cols = Victim_violence:Parent_divorce, names_to = \"Type\",values_to = \"Experience\" )\nggplot(victim_mental, aes(x = Experience, fill = Child_mental_struggle)) + \n    geom_bar() + \n    facet_wrap(~Type) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = icecreamcolors)\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides unfair treatment out of chidren’s identities, children may so suffer from other unpleasing experience like violence, living with people with alcohol or drug, or parent divorce. To investigate and compare the relationship between those experience and mental health, we drew a stacked bar chart with facets.\nThe variables included in the bar chart are:\nChild_mental_struggle: shows whether the child has mental health issues, and it returns “Yes” if the child suffers from any type of mental issues, and “No” otherwise.\nAlcohol_drug: referred as ACE9 in the original data, showing whether the child has experience living with people with alcohol or drug issues.\nParent_divorce: referred as ACE3 in the original data, showing whether the child has experienced parent divorce.\nVictim_violence: referred as ACE7 in the original data, showing whether the child has been a victim of violence.\nUpon comparing the proportions represented by each segment of the stacked bars, a notable pattern emerges. Remarkably, over 50% of children who have experienced living with individuals facing alcohol or drug issues exhibit some form of mental health challenges. Similarly, a significant majority of children who have been victims of violence also demonstrate a higher prevalence of mental health issues. In contrast, children whose parents have undergone divorce show a lower ratio, with less than half experiencing mental health concerns. While this percentage is comparatively lower than those associated with other adverse experiences, it is essential to note that children with divorced parents still exhibit a higher likelihood of facing mental health problems when compared to those who haven’t experienced parental divorce.\n\n\n3.3.3 What’s the relationship between children’s grade at school and mental health issues\n\n\nCode\nvalue_mapping &lt;- data.frame(original=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),\n                            replacement=c(\"Mostly A\", \"Mostly A and B\", \"Mostly B and C\", \"Mostly C and D\",\"Mostly D and E\", \"Unknown\"))\ngrade_mental &lt;- nsch_df |&gt;\n  mutate(Child_mental_struggle = ifelse(rowSums(nsch_df[, mental_ls] == 1) &gt; 0,\"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Grade=value_mapping$replacement[match(GRADES,value_mapping$original)]) |&gt;\n  #mutate(Depression = ifelse(nsch_df$K2Q32A == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  #mutate(Grade = ifelse(nsch_df$GRADES == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(Grade,Child_mental_struggle)|&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n())\n\nggplot(grade_mental, aes(axis1 = Grade, axis2 = Child_mental_struggle, y=Freq)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Grade), width = 1/12) +\n  geom_stratum() +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = paste(after_stat(stratum)#, \"\\n\", after_stat(count) \n                                                )))+\n  ggtitle(\"Relationship between Grade at School and Mental Health Issues\")+\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"GRADES\", \"Child_mental_struggle\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren’s grades may also be correlated with mental health. To study the relationship between grades and mental health issues, we made an Alluvial Diagram.\nThere are two variables in the diagram:\nGRADES: shows the grade of a child at school and it has six levels: mostly A’s, mostly A’s and B’s, mostly B’s and C’s, mostly C’s and D’s, mostly D’s and E’s, and unknown if the school don’t provide grades.\nChild_mental_struggle: shows whether the child has mental health issues, and it returns “Yes” if the child suffers from any type of mental issues, and “No” otherwise.\nThe findings underscore a significant correlation between academic performance and mental health among children. Notably, those who predominantly receive C’s and D’s, or D’s and E’s, exhibit a notably higher likelihood of experiencing mental health issues compared to their counterparts with better grades. Furthermore, the trend indicates that as academic performance improves, the likelihood of mental health issues decreases.\nThis correlation aligns with a logical interpretation: children facing challenges in academic achievement, marked by lower grades, may experience feelings of depression or anxiety. Conversely, children dealing with mental health issues may encounter difficulties concentrating in class, potentially impacting their academic performance negatively. The observed relationship suggests a mutual effect between grades and mental health.\nThe result provide suggestions for educators and parents. It emphasizes the importance of support systems that consider both academic and mental well-being. Targeted interventions addressing the reciprocal relationship between grades and mental health can contribute to fostering a positive and supportive learning environment for children."

We only have one variable: Num_Mental_Issues, which shows the number of mental issues each child has. It is calculated by counting the number of “Yes” in different mental health issues of each child.\nFrom the result, we can see that the majority of children don’t have any mental health issues, or only suffer from one mental disease. However, there are still a lot of children suffering from multiple mental issues. It is likely that some mental issues have mutual effect on each other, and we need to investigate more on it.\n\n\n3.4.2 The relationship between Depression, Anxiety and ADD/ADHD\n\n\nCode\nmental_issues &lt;- nsch_df |&gt;\n  mutate(Depression = ifelse(nsch_df$K2Q32A == 1, \"Deression\", \"No Depression\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Anxiety = ifelse(nsch_df$K2Q33A == 1, \"Anxiety\", \"No Anxiety\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(ADD_ADHD = ifelse(nsch_df$K2Q31A == 1, \"ADD/ADHD\", \"No ADD/ADHD\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(Depression,Anxiety,ADD_ADHD)|&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n())\n\nggplot(mental_issues, aes(axis1 = Depression, axis2 = Anxiety, axis3=ADD_ADHD, y=Freq)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Depression)) +\n  geom_stratum() +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = paste(after_stat(stratum))))+\n  ggtitle(\"Relationship between Mental Health Issues\")+\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Depression\", \"Anxiety\",\"ADD_ADHD\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nDepression, anxiety and ADD/ADHD are three very common mental health issues, and they are likely to affect each other. To explore if children with one of the issues are more likely to have other issues as well, we drew an Alluvial Diagram of three variables:\nDepression: referred as K2Q32A in the original data, showing whether the children has ever had depression\nAnxiety: referred as K2Q33A in the original data, showing whether the children has ever had anxiety\nADD/ADHD: referred as K2Q31A in the original data, showing whether the children has ever had ADD/ADHD\nFrom the graph, we can see that the majority of children who suffer from depression also suffer from anxiety. Additionally, approximately half of those contending with both depression and anxiety also exhibit symptoms of ADD/ADHD. Moreover, an apparent correlation is observed between anxiety and ADD/ADHD, with nearly half of the children diagnosed with ADD/ADHD also reporting symptoms of anxiety.\nThese findings align with expectations, as depression often coexists with anxiety. Additionally, the challenges of concentration faced by children with ADD/ADHD may contribute to feelings of distress or anxiety. By fostering an understanding that depression, anxiety, and ADD/ADHD are not isolated entities but rather components of a complex web, parents and educators can play pivotal roles in providing comprehensive and tailored support. This involves not only addressing specific symptoms but also acknowledging the potential effects that each condition may have on the others."

Which means most people exercise 1-3 days a week, and large proportion do 4-6 days a week. It is less likely to exercise everyday or 0 days a week.\nChildren with Depression tend to do less physical activities. Although the total counts is significantly less than ADD/ADHD and Anxiety, the number of people doing no sports at all is similar.\nChildren with Speech DIsorder tend to do more physical activities: the proportion of children doing sports everyday is higher than average, and the proportion of children doing no sports is lower than average.\nFor every subpopulation (represented by bars), the rate of physical pain appears to be similar. From this graph, it is hard to tell the difference across subpopulations, so we cannot give conclusion on general patterns of physical pain."

    "text": "When the guardians has Some College Credit, but No Degree or Associate Degree (AA, AS), their child is slightly easier to be told to have mental among all education level. When the guardian identify themselves to complete 12th grade or less school as highest education experience, a smaller proportion of their child is reported to have mental health struggles. Among children who have mental disease and have a guardian reporting a poor mental status, a larger proportion is having Anxiety comparing to other disease. For children received treatment, the median age of their guardians is higher than the guardians of children who didn’t receive treatments.\nChildren who have experiences of unfair treatment because of gender identity and sexual orientation, being a victim of violence, living with people with alcohol or drug issues, and parent divorce are more likely to have mental health problems. Besides, children’s grades at school and mental health have a mutual effect on each other.\nMany children suffer from more than one mental health issues. Specifically, most children who have depression also suffer from anxiety. Half of the children with ADD/ADHD also have anxiety. Therefore, some mental health issues have mutual impact on each other.\nMost children with mental problems exercise 1-3 days a week. Among all problems, children with depression normally exercise less, and children with Speech Disorder likes to do more physical activities. The rate of physical pain has no obvious pattern across mental issues and exercise frequency.\nOne Limitation of our project is that most of our data is basically categorical, so the types of plots we can drew is very limited, and our conclusion is qualitative rather than quantitative. Further research may collect some numerical data about children’s mental health in the US and conduct some statistical tests to validate our conclusions."
