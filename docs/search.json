    "text": "2.1 Description\n\n2.1.1 Data Source\nWe obtained the data from the United States Census Bureau Website, which is an official website of the US government. The data is collected from 2022 NSCH (National Survey of Children’s Health), a national and state-level survey on information related to the physical and mental health of children from 0 to 17 years old. The survey is conducted by the United States Census Bureau, Associate Director for Demographic Programs on behalf of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) .\n\n\n2.1.2 Format of the data, Frequency of updates, Dimensions\nThe 2022 Topical Data is originally in SAS format. The NSCH is conducted every year, so the data is collected and released every year. Specifically, the NSCH 2022 was collected from July 2022 to January 2023. The data has two dimensions. Each row represents a sample, and each column represents the answers to each question in the questionnaires. The 2022 Topical Data file includes records for 54,103 children (54103 rows), and there are answers to 490 questions for each child (490 columns). Issues / problems with the data The data is collected from questionnaires, so some information may not be complete. The 2022 topical data file involves both the complete and sufficient partial topical questionnaires. Therefore, we need to deal with missing values before we conduct analyses. Besides, the data involves different aspects of children’s health and well-being, but our purpose is to focus on children’s mental health. So we need to carefully identify and choose the relevant information from the 490 columns.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Import the data\nThe original data is in SAS format, and it is not that easy to analyze. Thus, we plan to convert the data to csv format manually and store it as “nsch.csv”. Then, we just need to import the “nsch.csv” file into R-studio in DataFrame format to prepare the data for analyses."

Mental health issues in childhood not only affect the individual child but can also have lasting effects into adulthood. Understanding the determinants of mental health in children is crucial for developing effective interventions and support systems. It carries public health significance, contributing to the overall understanding of mental health burdens, influencing families and communities, and informing evidence-based policies and programs."

Are children whose guardians have higher education more likely to have anxiety? Do children tend to have better mental health if their guardians have better mental health? How does Guardian’s military experience influence children’s mental status? Whether the age of Guardians and children serve as a potential factor of mental health issues?\nChildren’s experience and mental health: Are children more likely to be depressed if they have been treated unfairly because of gender identity or sexual orientation? How does being a victim of violence, living with people with alcohol problems, and experiencing parent divorce affect children’s mental health respectively?\nMutual effect of mental health problems on children: Do children who have one mental issue tend to suffer from other problems as well? How do other factors affect the number of mental illnesses children have?"
