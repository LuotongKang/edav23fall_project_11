    "text": "1.2 Motivation\nChildren’s mental health is a subject of increasing concern in contemporary society, with growing awareness of the impact of early experiences on long-term mental and emotional outcomes. Mental health issues in childhood not only affect the individual child but can also have lasting effects into adulthood. Understanding the determinants of mental health in children is crucial for developing effective interventions and support systems. It carries public health significance, contributing to the overall understanding of mental health burdens, influencing families and communities, and informing evidence-based policies and programs."

    "text": "1.3 Research Questions\n\nThe relationship between Children’s mental health and Guardians’ background: How do guardians’ employment status affect children’s mental health? Are children whose guardians have higher education more likely to have anxiety? Do children tend to have better mental health if their guardians have better mental health? How does Guardian’s military experience influence children’s mental status? Whether the age of Guardians and children serve as a potential factor of mental health issues?\nChildren’s experience and mental health: Are children more likely to be depressed if they have been treated unfairly because of gender identity or sexual orientation? How does being a victim of violence, living with people with alcohol problems, and experiencing parent divorce affect children’s mental health respectively?\nMutual effect of mental health problems on children: Do children who have one mental issue tend to suffer from other problems as well? How do other factors affect the number of mental illnesses children have?\nRelationship between physical health and mental health."

    "text": "2.1 Description\n\n2.1.1 Data Source\nWe obtained the data from the United States Census Bureau Website, which is an official website of the US government. The data is collected from 2022 NSCH (National Survey of Children’s Health), a national and state-level survey on information related to the physical and mental health of children from 0 to 17 years old. The survey is conducted by the United States Census Bureau, Associate Director for Demographic Programs on behalf of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) .\n\n\n2.1.2 Format of the data, Frequency of updates, Dimensions\nThe 2022 Topical Data is originally in SAS format. The NSCH is conducted every year, so the data is collected and released every year. Specifically, the NSCH 2022 was collected from July 2022 to January 2023. The data has two dimensions. Each row represents a sample, and each column represents the answers to each question in the questionnaires. The 2022 Topical Data file includes records for 54,103 children (54103 rows), and there are answers to 490 questions for each child (490 columns). Issues / problems with the data The data is collected from questionnaires, so some information may not be complete. The 2022 topical data file involves both the complete and sufficient partial topical questionnaires. Therefore, we need to deal with missing values before we conduct analyses. Besides, the data involves different aspects of children’s health and well-being, but our purpose is to focus on children’s mental health. So we need to carefully identify and choose the relevant information from the 490 columns.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Import the data\nThe original data is in SAS format, and it is not that easy to analyze. Thus, we plan to convert the data to csv format manually and store it as “nsch.csv”. Then, we just need to import the “nsch.csv” file into R-studio in DataFrame format to prepare the data for analyses."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\n\n2.2.1 Census Question Columns\nBased on the 4 big categories of research questions, we select different census questions to explore:\n\nParents / Environment\nA1_ACTIVE, A1_AGE, A1_BORN, A1_EMPLOYED, A1_GRADE, A1_MARITAL, A1_MENTHEALTH, A1_PHYSHEALTH, FAMILY_R, HHCOUNT, HIGRADE_TVIS, HOMEEVIC, HOPEFUL\nThese variables are basic information of guardians like whether they’ve served on active duty, the education level, life attitude, physical and mental health self-evaluation. Living environments like family structure and household sizes can be also considered when evaluating the correlation with mental health issues.\nChildren’s Experience\nACE1, ACE10, ACE11, ACE12, ACE3, ACE4, ACE5, ACE6, ACE7, ACE8, ACE9, BULLIED_R, BULLY, EVERHOMELESS, GRADES\nIn this category, guardians are asked to unveil their child’s traumatic experience like being treated unfairly and living in an unsettled environment. In addition, experience of peer relationship (bully, grade) are also subjects to be tested.\nPhysical Health\nFASD, GENETIC, HOURSLEEP, PHYSACTIV, PHYSICALPAIN\nBy accessing the relation between mental health issues and physical health factors like activity frequency and hours of sleep, we can answer the last category of questions.\nMental Health Indicator\nK2Q30A, K2Q31A, K2Q32A, K2Q33A, K2Q34A, K2Q35A, K2Q37A, K2Q38A, K4Q22_R, K4Q23\nThese are the target variables, which includes YES/NO questions on whether this child is diagnosed to have mental health issues. Except for 8 health problems, we also have the information that whether this child has taken treatments/medication or not.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Visualizations\nSince almost all questions in this census have categorical answers, we can use contingency tables to draw stacked bar charts, Cleveland dot plots and mosaic plots to see the correlation. As shown above, we kept a large set of variables to explore, and we might want to try PCA as well to reduce dimension.\nPlease refer to the official variable list provided on the website for detailed question prompts."

If we check the meaning of variables, we can see that these columns are questions related to “Child Experienced”. The question prompt starts with “To the best of your knowledge”, and only 2 options (1=Yes or 2=No) are provided. People who take the questionaire might take this question as an optional one and leave it blank when they are unsure about the answer. If our inference here is correct, we can drop those rows without concerning serious effects.\n\n\n2.3.2 Frequency of rowSums()\nFor other columns, we would want to look at the rowSums() frequency.\nWe are going to first remove columns starts with “ACE” (see previous section for analysis) and columns with 0 missing values. Then we filter to only include rows containing NA. We can see the dimension of missing value dataframe:\n\n\nCode\nnsch_df_except_ace &lt;- nsch_df[,-seq(16,25)]\ncol_wo_na &lt;- c(\"HHID\", \"A1_GRADE\", \"HHCOUNT\", \"HIGRADE_TVIS\")\ncol_names &lt;- names(nsch_df_except_ace)\nnsch_df_except_ace &lt;- nsch_df_except_ace[,-which(col_names %in% col_wo_na)]\nmissing_except_ace &lt;- is.na(nsch_df_except_ace)\nnsch_df_except_ace &lt;- nsch_df_except_ace[apply(missing_except_ace, 1, any), ]\ndim(nsch_df_except_ace)\n\n\n[1] 3547   30\n\n\nThen, we can draw the frequency bar chart of the missing vale of each row.\n\n\nCode\nfreq_table_na_each_row &lt;- rowSums(is.na(nsch_df_except_ace)) |&gt; table()\nbarplot(freq_table_na_each_row, cex.names=0.6,\n        main=\"Frequency of Missing Value Counts of Each Row\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values represented by each bin are:\n\n\nCode\nfreq_table_na_each_row\n\n\n\n   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16 \n2636  402  159   89  102   42   31   26   23    9   10    8    4    1    3    1 \n  18 \n   1 \n\n\nAfter ignoring missing value in “ACE” columns, we can see among 3547 rows containing missing values, 2636 of them only have 1 value missing. This indicates that it is unlikely to have causal relationship between missing values in columns. We are going to validate this statement by drawing a correlation matrix on missing values.\n\n\n2.3.3 Correlation Matrix\nUsing an indicator dataframe, we put 1 on the position where the truncated dataframe has NA in that position, and put 0 otherwise. We are going to draw a correlation matrix of this indicator to see whether missing a value in column A lead to missing a value in column B.\n\n\nCode\ncor_matrix &lt;- cor(as.data.frame(missing_except_ace) +1-1)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# Reshape the correlation matrix for ggplot\ncor_df &lt;- as.data.frame(as.table(cor_matrix))\nnames(cor_df) &lt;- c(\"Var1\", \"Var2\", \"Corr\")\n\n# Plot the correlation matrix using ggplot2\nheatmap &lt;- ggplot(cor_df, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = Corr)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", size = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\", mid=\"white\",\n                       name = \"Correlation\", midpoint = 0) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Correlation Matrix\")\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nCode\n# Display the plot\nprint(heatmap)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see no extreme correlation is found. Given that the dataset is large enough and most columns are categorical, we choose to remove missing values.\n\n\n2.3.4 Drop and Save\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nwrite.csv(drop_na(nsch_df), \"data/nsch_dropna.csv\", row.names = FALSE)"
